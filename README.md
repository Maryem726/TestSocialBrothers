- While lunching the project: 
The list of addresses will be retrieved from the database and displayed in one table automatically with the Route("") or with the main Route of the controller("Addresses").

_ DataBase file: addressDB generated by SQLite

- Get all addresses interface with their informations is developed (FrontEnd part)

- Crud and search API are developed and tested with swagger with the URL "https://localhost:port/swagger/index.html".

- (all fields are mendatory while adding or updating an address)
     - PUT: the address ID mush be specified before changing any fields
            NO field can be empty 
            
- Filter and Sort API:
     - Filter: you can add a string or int variable to search with based on all the address's fields 
     - Sort: If the sortOrder written is equal to one of the fields name, for exemple "City", the parametr will take another value for exemple "city_desc" and the results will be sorted in a descending order, if not the parameter will take the sortOrder value and sort the results automatically in ascending order.
     
     
- Parts proud of: Implementing the exact search idea and sort idea with the specific details and code 
- Parts less satisifed with / i wanted to complete: 
     - the address's fields headings in the table are displayed as hyperlinks, and once clicking on one field's heading, it will change the order from asending to    descending
     - The distance calculation between 2 addresses
